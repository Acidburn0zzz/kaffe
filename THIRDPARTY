* m4/ax_cflags_gcc_option.m4, m4/ax_cflags_warn_all.m4, m4/acx_pthread.m4,

Autoconf macros to check for accepted warning and compiler options, pthreads 
and compile time values. Taken from the Autoconf Macro Archive at 
http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/.

Licensed under the GNU General Public License with a special exception:

    Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software; you

    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited 
    permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that 
    are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU 
    General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even 
    though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU 
    General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material 
    that constitutes the Autoconf program.

    Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied 
    (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of 
    Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf 
    source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides 
    which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these 
    comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never 
    copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

    This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf 
    released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute 
    a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception 
    to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your 
    modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the 
    text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started 
    with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from 
    the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has 
    such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception to 
    the GPL from your modified version.

   or incorporates Python 2.3 or any part thereof, and wants to make
   the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
   Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
   the changes made to Python 2.3.

   6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
   breach of its terms and conditions.

   relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and

  SOFTWARE RIGHTS

  ANTLR 1989-2004 Developed by Terence Parr
  Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com

  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
  public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
  they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
  code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
  ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
  we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
  ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
  incorporate any source code into one of your programs
  (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
  you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
  research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
  developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
  you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
  headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
  guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
  system and expect to make other tools available as they are
  completed.
