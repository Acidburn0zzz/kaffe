GNU JAXP is distributed under the GNU General Public License, with 
the "library exception" which permits its use as a library in 
conjunction with non-Free software:

  "As a special exception, if you link this library with other 
   files to produce an executable, this library does not by itself 
   cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General 
   Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any 
   other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU 
   General Public License."

See license.terms for the text of the GNU General Public License.

* javax.net, javax.net.ssl, javax.security.cert

This code has been merged in from Jessie. Kaffe tracks this
projects' CVS HEAD.

Jessie is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. The implementations of javax.net, javax.net.ssl, and 
javax.security.cert packages are additionally covered by the following
exception:

    "Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
    is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms 
    and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole 
    combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library 
    give you permission to link this library with independent modules 
    to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of 
    these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the 
    resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you 
    also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and 
    conditions of the license of that module. An independent module 
    is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your 
    version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you 
    do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your 
    version."

* Class library

Parts of kaffe's class library were merged in from GNU
Classpath. Work continues on replacing kaffe's classes where they
have been superseeded by GNU Classpath's implementation. Kaffe tracks
this projects's CVS HEAD.

Thanks to Stuart Ballard and Ito Kazumitsu, who started the merge
effort, and Mark Wielaard, who provided a lot of useful advice on GNU
Classpath's implementation.

License  with the following clarification and special exception:

   "Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules 
  is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and 
  conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole 
  combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give 
  you permission to link this library with independent modules to 
  produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these 
  independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting 
  executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, 
  for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the 
  license of that module. An independent module is a module which is 
  not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, 
  you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you 
  are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this 
  exception statement from your version."
