GSM, MP3 and ogg support. Kaffe tracks this project's CVS HEAD.

Thanks to Matthias Pfisterer from the tritonus project, who was very
helpful during the merge.

Tritonus is distrubuted under the GNU Library General Public License.

the "library exception" which permits its use as a library in 
conjunction with non-Free software:

  "As a special exception, if you link this library with other 
   files to produce an executable, this library does not by itself 
   cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General 
   Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any 
   other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU 
   General Public License."

This code has been merged in from Jessie. Kaffe tracks this
projects' CVS HEAD.

Jessie is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. The implementations of javax.net, javax.net.ssl, and 
javax.security.cert packages are additionally covered by the following
exception:

    "Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
    is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms 
    and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole 
    combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library 
    give you permission to link this library with independent modules 
    to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of 
    these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the 
    resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you 
    also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and 
    conditions of the license of that module. An independent module 
    is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your 
    version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you 
    do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your 
    version."

* gnu.inet

FTP URL Connection handler and utility classes are taken from GNU 
Inetlib's CVS. 

They are licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License \

    License. This exception does not however invalidate any other 
    reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General
    Public License."

effort, and Mark Wielaard, who provided a lot of useful advice on GNU
Classpath's implementation.

* m4/ax_cflags_gcc_option.m4, ax_cflags_warn_all.m4

Autoconf macros to check for accepted warning and compiler options. Taken
from the Autoconf Macro Archive at http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/.

Licensed under the GNU General Public License with a special exception:

    Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software; you
    can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU 
    General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; 
    either version 2, or (at your option) any later version.

    They are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but WITHOUT 
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License

    Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free 
    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place -- Suite 330, Boston, MA 
    02111-1307, USA.)

    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited 
    permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that 
    are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU 
    General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even 
    though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU 
    General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material 
    that constitutes the Autoconf program.

    Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied 
    (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of 
    Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf 
    source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides 
    which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these 
    comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never 
    copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

    This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf 
    released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute 
    a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception 
    to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your 
    modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the 
    text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started 
    with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from 
    the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has 
    such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception to 
    the GPL from your modified version.
