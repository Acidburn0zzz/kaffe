	* config/i386/common.h (sysdepCallMethod): Do not use extern
	inline, it prevents compilation without optimization; use static
	inline instead.
	* config/sparc/common.h (sysdepCallMethod): Rewrite as a static
	inline function, in a well-documented way, suitable for easy
	adaptation to other platforms, without *any* asm statement.
	* kaffe/kaffevm/support.c (PROMOTE_TO_64bits): Define
	PROMOTE_jint2jlong and PROMOTE_jfloat2jdouble.
	(PROMOTE_jint2jlong): Arrange that all integer types are promoted
	to 64bit words.  It currently doesn't cause padding arguments to
	be added if needed.
	(PROMOTE_jfloat2jdouble): Arrange that all floats are promoted to
	double.
	(PROM_DIV): If PROMOTE_jint2jlong and PROMOTE_jfloat2jdouble are
	defined, and pointers are as wide as two ints, set to 2,
	otherwise, set to 1.
	(callMethodA, callMethodV): Promote jints to jlongs and jfloats to 
	jdoubles where appropriate.  Divide all sizes of jfloats, jlongs,
	jdoubles and jrefs by PROM_DIV, and eliminate padding arguments if
	possible.
	* config/alpha/common.h (sysdepCallMethod): Rewrite as a static
	inline function very similar with the one for sparc.  Define
	PROMOTE_TO_64bits, since all arguments are 64bits, so that we
	don't have to skip holes.
	* kaffe/kaffevm/support.c (ALIGN_AT_64bits, callMethodA,
	callMethodV): If ALIGN_AT_64bits is defined, insert padding 32-bit 
	arguments as needed for 64bit ones to be aligned at even positions 
	in the array of arguments.

	* config/config.alias: Cygnus has renamed cygwin32 to cygwin, but
	our config directory is still named cygwin32.

	* configure.in: Modify --with-libraries so that it also adds
	directories to the run-time search path.  Drop --with-rtlibraries,
	now that it's useless.  Do not add assume -I/usr/local/include if
	--with-includes is specified, nor -L/usr/local/lib for
	--with-libraries.  If X_LIBS contains any -L flag but no -R, add
	one -R for each -L.
	* FAQ/FAQ.automake: Remove references to --with-rtlibraries.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

	* libltdl/ltdl.c: Update from libtool.  Remove warnings.  Bug
	fixes for HP/UX.

	* config/i386/common.h (sysdepCallMethod): Update comments, and
	optimize a bit further.

	* config/i386/beos/config.frag: removed explicit definition for CFLAGS
	because it interfered with --disable-debug option

	* config/i386/common.h (sysdepCallMethod): Rewrite so that it
	compiles with egcs snapshots.  Make it an extern inline function,
	to ease debugging.  It will only be defined if
	NEED_sysdepCallMethod is defined.
	* kaffe/kaffevm/support.c: Include support.h and define
	NEED_sysdepCallMethod before machine.h.

Fri Apr  9 14:00:00 PDT 1999 Transvirtual Technologies <info@transvirtual.com>

        * Version 1.0.b4 of Kaffe OpenVM released.
