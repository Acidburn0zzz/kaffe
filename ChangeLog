	* configure.ac: Don't check for no-cpp-precomp. It confuses
	libtool on 64 bit platforms to think that -fPIC is not supported, 
	leading to fascinating relinking errors. A better way for older
	darwin release must be found to deal with preprocessor breakage.
	It also lead to tons of pointless warning messages on all systems
	beside the -no-cpp-supporting ones, so it needs to go in this form.

	* replace/Makefile.am (libreplace_la_LDFLAGS): Removed -export-dynamic.

See ChangeLog.16 for earlier changes.
