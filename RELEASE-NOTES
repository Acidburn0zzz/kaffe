Release Notes for 1.1.3
=======================

Release 1.1.3 of Kaffe is a "development" release.

It has been tested, but not as thoroughly as a
production release would be.

Please check the WHATSNEW file to see what has
been added in this release.

Even though this is not a production release, it
contains a lot of improvements over 1.0.7, which
was release over half a year ago.  I anticipate
that most people will have less trouble with
this release.

Bug reports, comments and patches are always
welcome -- send them to the team at kaffe@kaffe.org.

Have fun!

Cheers,

 - Jim
