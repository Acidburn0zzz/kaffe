* Engine changes:
 * Merge in JIT4
 * Merge in vmgenned interpreter from Cacao
 * JIT must support thread concurrency. 
   Variable must be in thread local storage and not globally visible.
 * Add support for gcj-ed code with BC ABI.
 * Merge in Tom Tromey's libjit and llvm based JITs.

* Cleanup
 * Remove unused instructions from jits (nop, unimplemented)

* Architectural changes:
 * Make threading model runtime selectable.
 * Make runtime engine runtime selectable
 * Make gc backend runtime selectable
 * Make boehm-gc the default engine on platforms that support it
 * Swich to glib for data structures, command line option parsing, etc.
 * Switch to libjclassinfo for class file parsing
  * Switch to libzzlib for zip file reading first to be able to kill the syscall
    interface in the threading code.

* Missing features
 * Implement support for extension override mechanism, and allow overriding
   with older versions of APIs as well, which is needed for DOM.
 * Implement hooks for annotations from GNU Classpath.
 * Implement hooks for JMX from GNU Classpath.
 * Implement hooks for JVMTI from GNU Classpath. 

* Integration issues
 * Remove jikes from checked compiler list. Otoh, it's the only real option on Cygwin atm. 
   So the answer is probably to avoid having any 1.5+ Java code in vmreference, and to avoid
   any deviation from Classpath's VM interface.
 * Update java.lang.ref vminterface to latest version.
 * Switch over to GNU Classpath's javah and remove kaffeh
  * Replace native library code using KNI with code using JNI

* Unmerging work
  * Remove GNU MP big math
  * Remove old Kaffe AWT implementations

* Merging work:
  * sun.misc.Unsafe native implementation from openjdk/cacao for full jsr166 support.
  * zip library from openjdk
  * verifier from gcj (rob gonzalez)
  * SkyOS port

* Build system: (dalibor)
  * Remove convenience libraries (gc, engine, threading) and make them part of libkaffe_la_SOURCES
  * Remove symlinked files, and replace them by adding the 'right' file to SOURCES
  * make sure all noinst_HEADERS are part of _SOURCES.
  * Use AS_IF and AS_CASE all over the configure script.
  * Non-recursive build, single Makefile.am for kaffe.
  * Switch to autotest for the test suites

* Pending patches 
  amd64 jit from Eric Anholt (guilhem)
