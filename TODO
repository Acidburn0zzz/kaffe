* Create test cases for:
 * symlink deletion(already fixed)
 * writer.close() flushing the internal buffer on encoder(already fixed)
 * Calendar.getInstance().get(YEAR) returning non-zero

* Architectural changes:
 * Make threading model runtime selectable.
 * Make runtime engine runtime selectable
 * Make gc backend runtime selectable

* Nasty bugs:
 * Figure out deadlock issues with System.gc() on smp(finalexc, ClassGC,
   GCTest all fail on smp).

* Missing features
 * Implement support for extension override mechanism, and allow overriding
   with older versions of APIs as well, which is needed for DOM.

* Merging work:
  * From GNU Classpath:
    java.util.zip, java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.lang
  * gcjwebplugin
  * verifier from gcj (rob gonzalez)

* Build system: (dalibor)
  * Explicit support to use an installed javac/jikes/gcjx/kjc for bootstrap
  * Build java libs first, then run kaffeh on them to generate the
  native headers, and then build the rest of kaffe. That should get rid of 
  Klasses.jar.bootstrap.
  * Make make dist and make distclean work without hickups.
  * Fix GNU Make dependencies.
  * Non-recursive build, single Makefile.am for kaffe.

* Pending patches (dalibor)
  * Gerrit Haase's Cygwin patches 
  * L4 port from Ronald Aigner ?
  * Whatever got dropped on the list
  * Regular resyncing with GNU Classpath, gjdoc.
