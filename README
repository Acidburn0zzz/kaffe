			 KAFFE OpenVM 1.0 Beta 3

			 =======================

This is of "Kaffe OpenVM", a complete virtual machine and class library
set which allows the execution of Java code without any code from Javasoft.
It comes with a virtual machine and a set of class libraries including beans,
and the all important AWT graphics system.

Why use Kaffe?
--------------

Because Kaffe is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License
which means the source code is free for you to download, modify and use.

What systems does Kaffe support?
-------------------------------

Most of the porting issues of Kaffe are in the virtual machine itself
(after all the rests in Java an inherently portable) so we may not
support all the platforms you might want, but we support an amazing number
and we'll add more as we can.  Take a look at the list below to see if
Kaffe will run on your system ('J' means 'just-in-time' while 'I' means
'interpreter'):

  ========================================================================
  uProc     | Mode |    Systems
  ========================================================================
  i386      | J+I  |    Linux 2.x       FreeBSD 2.x +   NetBSD 1.x
            |      |    Solaris 2.x     BSDI 2.x        Unixware

  ========================================================================

Kaffe also ships with some code which used to work but has now fallen
behind recent changes.  If you wanted to update these ports feel free:

Who can use Kaffe?
------------------

Kaffe OpenVM is distributed under the GPL (GNU Public License).  Please
read the license to make sure it's okay to use it in your circumstances.  If
not, you can always contact us at Transvirtual and ask about alternatives.

Where do I find new copies of Kaffe?
------------------------------------

Kaffe is available from various sites.  The primary site is:

        ftp://ftp.transvirtual.com/pub/kaffe/

While Kaffe is being developed, look for daily snapshots of the latest
version, including the most recent bug fixes, at:

        ftp://ftp.transvirtual.com/pub/kaffe/kaffe-snap.tar.gz

What about a web site?
----------------------

News about the "Open Source" Kaffe distribution can always be found at:

	http://www.transvirtual.com/

And mailing lists?
------------------

A couple of mailing lists are available for information and discussion of
the Kaffe project.  These lists are:
  
        kaffe@rufus.w3.org                          - General discussions
        kaffe-announce@rufus.w3.org                 - Announcements

These lists are archived at:

	http://rufus.w3.org/tools/Kaffe/messages/

To subscribe to these lists send a message containing the word "subscribe"
to either:
        
        kaffe-request@rufus.w3.org
        kaffe-announce-request@rufus.w3.org
  
depending on what you are interested in.

How do I compile kaffe?
-----------------------

For UNIX it couldn't be simpler.

The machine comes complete with the interpreter, stub generator, and
supporting native libraries.   Compilation is controlled using the
GNU autoconf program.  To generate the necessary makefiles
type "./configure" in this directory.  This will identify your system
and configure the software appropriately.  If JIT mode is supported on your
system it will be selected automatically, otherwise it defaults to
interpreting mode.  Compilation should then be a simple matter of
typing "make" in this directory.

By default, the system will install into the /usr/local hierarchy as per
the standard GNU coding rules.  This can be changed using the --prefix
option to configure.  To install the binaries type "make install".

To avoid conflicts with Javasoft's products, Kaffe can be reconfigured in a
number of ways:

1. Use the --program-prefix configure option to prepend a string to all
   command names.
2. Use the --prefix configure option to place the kaffe installation tree
   somewhere other than /usr/local.

For Windows 95/98/NT it's a little different.

The only 'working' port to Windows '95 uses Cygnus's GNU tools for Windows
(available from http://www.cygnus.com/ - don't ask me how to install them!)
To configure you would type the following:

        ./configure --prefix=c:/kaffe

This would configure Kaffe to install in c:/kaffe and build in the source
directories.

Compilation and installation is as per the UNIX system.

Running Kaffe
=============

No environment configuration is necessary to run kaffe.  However, you may 
want to include the directory in which kaffe is installed in your path.  
Typically, this would be /usr/local/bin:

        PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

All necessary setup is taken care of by `kaffe' (note the lower case),
which is actually a driver shell script for the `Kaffe' executable.

Note that you don't have to setup the CLASSPATH - if you do then that's
fine, but if you don't kaffe will construct a classpath that has the
current directory plus the Jar and Zip files it needs to run.  For the 
details of how the CLASSPATH is set up, refer to kaffe/scripts/kaffe.in.

If you want to test the kaffe executable you built, type
"make all install", cd into the test directory of your build tree,
and type "make test".  This will run a suite of tests to check that 
your Kaffe executable is in fact working.
